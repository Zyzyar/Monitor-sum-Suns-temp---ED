# Monitor-sum-all-Suns-temperatures-ED
Very useful for explorers in Elite Dangerous - a monitor for the sum of temperatures of all stars in the currently visited system. 1 - Download both files. 2 - Place both files on your desktop. 3 - In the startup .bat file, adjust the path to YOUR desktop. 4 - Click: start.bat = a window will appear showing sum star temperatures. 5 - window has a "over other windows" function and you can move it wherever you want and change its size - for example to second monitor. It accurately measures the sum of temperatures of all stars after the second manual click on the FSS with the mouse. Thats all!

  The following are required on Windows:
- Python (e.g., Python 3.x) must be installed, as the script uses built-in libraries:
os, json, glob, time, tkinter (part of the standard Python installation).
- Threading (built into Python).
-Watchdog: This is an additional library that needs to be installed using the command in CMD: "pip install watchdog"
