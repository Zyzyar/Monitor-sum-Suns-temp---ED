# Monitor-sum-Suns-temp---ED
Very useful for explorers in Elite Dangerous - a monitor for the sum of temperatures of all stars in the currently visited system. 1 - Download both files. 2 - Place both files on your desktop. 3 - In the startup .bat file, adjust the path to YOUR desktop. 4 - Click: start.bat = a window will appear showing the star temperatures. 5 - window has a "over other windows" function and you can move it wherever you want and change its size. It accurately measures the sum of temperatures of all stars after the second manual click on the FSS with the mouse. Thats all!
